I am a 24yr old female and I have 4 years of retail experience and am a highly motivated, hard working and fast learning person. I am available weekdays and weekends and am flexible with hours. I have my own transport and would be available on short notice. I am willing to learn any skills necessary and am keen for either a kitchen or front of house staff position. (I have a 100/309 partner PR visa and have no restrictions on work hours).

Thank your for your consideration and please call me anytime for a interview.
